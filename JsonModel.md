Introduction
============
Metadata for Quark is represented with JSON. This file describes the structure of the JSON.

Elements
========

Root
----
    {
        version: '1.0',
        dataSources: [ DataSource... ],
        relSchema: { RelSchema ... }
    }
    
`version` (optional) if present should be equal to `1.0`.  
`dataSources` is a list of DataSource elements. Each element describes attributes about a 
`dataSource`.  
`relSchema` captures the relationships between tables in `DataSources`. `Cubes` and `Views` are 
supported right now.

DataSource
----------
Occurs within `root.dataSources`.

    {
        name:    'MYSQLDB'
        factory: 'com.qubole.quark.plugins.jdbc.JdbcFactory'
        url:     'jdbc://..../'
        default: 'true'
    }

`name` Name of the DataSource. `name` is used as the wrapper schema for all schemas and tables in
 this DataSource.   
`factory` Factory class to create DataSources. The class should implement 
`com.qubole.quark.DataSourceFactory`. Factories available out of the box are:  
   * `com.qubole.quark.plugins.jdbc.JdbcFactory` - Creates data sources that connect using a JDBC driver.
   * `com.qubole.quark.plugins.qubole.QuboleFactory` - Creates data sources that are hosted by QDS
`url` URL of the data source.  
`default` The default data source is used to determine the default schema.

JdbcDataSource
--------------
Like `DataSource` occurs within `root.DataSources`

    {
        type: 'MYSQL'
        username: 'user'
        password: 'pwd'
    }

`type` Type of database. Supported databases out of the box are:  
* EMR (Apache Hive on EMR)
* H2
* MYSQL
* REDSHIFT

`username` Username
`password` Password

QuboleDataSource
----------------
TODO

RelSchema
=========
Contains relationships between tables. The tables may be hosted in different data sources. Two 
types of relationships are supported.

    {
        views: [View ... ]
        cubes: [Cube ... ]
    }

`views` Describes materialized views on a table in one of the data sources. The materialized view
 maybe stored in a different data source.  
`cubes` Describes cubes generated on star schema join among tables in one of the data sources. 
The cube maybe stored in a different data source.     
    
Views
-----
Occurs in `root.relSchema`. Similar to materialized views in databases.

    {
        name: 'warehouse_big`
        query: 'select * from hive.tpcds.warehouse as wr where wr.w_warehouse_sq_ft > 100'
        dataSource: 'VIEWS'
        schema: 'PUBLIC'
        table: 'WAREHOUSE_PARTITION'
    }
    
`name` Name of the view.  
`query` Query that describes the materialized view.  
`dataSource` Data source where the materialized view is stored.  
`schema` Schema of the table where the materialized view is stored.
`table`  Name of the table where the materialized view is stored.
    
Cubes
-----
Occurs in `root.relSchema`.
    
    {
        name: 'web_returns_cube`
        query: 'select 1 from canonical.public.web_returns as w join canonical.public.item ...'
        destination: 'CUBES'
        schema: 'PUBLIC'
        table: 'WEB_RETURNS_CUBE'
        groupingColumn: 'GROUPING__ID'
        dimensions: [Dimension ...]
        measures: [Measure ...]
        groups:   [Group ...]
    }
    
`name` Name of the cube.  
`query` Query that describes the cube.  
`destination` Data source where the cube is stored.  
`schema` Schema of the table where the cube is stored.
`table`  Name of the table where the cube is stored.
`groupingColumn` Column that stores the number corresponding to the GROUPING bit vector 
associated with the row. 

Dimension
---------
Occurs in `root.relSchema.cubes`.

    {
        schema: '',
        table: 'i'
        column: 'i_item_id',
        cubeColumn: 'I_ITEM_ID',
        dimensionOrder: 0,
        name: 'Item Id',
        parent: null,
    }

`schema` Schema of the source table.  
`table`  Table name or alias of the source table.  
`column` Column name in the source table.  
`cubeColumn` Column in the cube table.  
`dimensionOrder` Ordinal number in the dimension list.  
`name` A descriptive name for the dimension. It should be unique. The name is used to identify 
parents and children in a dimension hierarchy.    
`parent` Cube Column Name of the parent dimension if its part of a hierarchy.  
     
Measure
-------
Occurs in `root.relSchema.cubes`
     
    {
        column: 'wr_net_loss',
        cubeColumn: 'TOTAL_NET_LOSS',
        function: 'sum',
    }
    
`column` Name of the column in the fact table.
`cubeColumn` Name of the column in the cube table.
`function` Aggregate function on the column in the fact table. Supported 
      
Group
-----
Occurs in `root.relSchema.cubes`
